# BasicSnakeGameJS
A classic game, snake, in javascript. 

Written using the canvas API and vanilla js, making this recreated a
                small piece of my childhood.<br /><br />
                Snake was always dear to me because of it's ubiquity, no matter
                who's flip phone you were on, it had snake. <br /><br />
                Really quite a simple implementation, it involves an edge looper
                so you don't 'fall off' the map, some collision detection so
                apples don't spawn inside the snake body and an array to keep
                track of recent movements to make sure that you haven't bumped
                into yourself and lost.<br /><br />
                Also included is a very simple but i think important
                functionality... the score! Without it the game doesn't have
                that addictive feel!
